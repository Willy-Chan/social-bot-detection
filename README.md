# Social Media Bot Detection using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection of social media bots using logistic regression. It aims to identify automated accounts on social media platforms, which can be a crucial tool in understanding and mitigating the impact of bots on social discourse.

## Features
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Utilizes a logistic regression algorithm for efficient and accurate bot detection.
- **Data Analysis:** In-depth analysis of social media data to identify bot-like behaviors.
- **Accuracy Metrics:** Evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics.

### Logistic Regression
This project employs logistic regression, a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (where there are only two possible outcomes). In this case, it's used to distinguish between bot and non-bot accounts based on various features.

### Classification Criteria
The model classifies accounts based on criteria such as:
- **Post History:** Frequency and patterns of posts, which are often indicative of automated behavior.
- **Account Characteristics:** Account creation date, profile completeness, etc.
- **Interaction Patterns:** Frequency and type of interactions with other users.

These features are fed into the logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an account being a bot.
